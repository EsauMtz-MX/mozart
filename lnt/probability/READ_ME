Here are the files for computing the probability of a rule
execution when a fixed probability was assigned to the environment
action triggering the rule.

The BCG model is not renamed, i.e., it contains the rule identifiers
on the transition labels, and the properties are expressed taking this
into account.

The properties concern the first execution of the composition expression,
i.e., before the first "DONE" is executed.

Files:

prop_r1.mcl		probabilistic properties attached to each rule
prop_r2.mcl
prob_r1.ren		assignments of envaction probabilities for each rule
prob_r2.ren		(not used here, but online in the SVL file)
check_proba.svl		SVL script launching the probabilistic verifications

Commands:

svl ./check_proba.svl "r1" "ENVACTION \!MOTION \!ELEM (ON, TRUE)"

creates a file "r1.dat" containing the values of the probabilities,
that can be used for plotting.

Similarly:

svl check_proba.svl "r2" "ENVACTION \!THERMO \!ELEM (TEMPERATURE, 30)"

creates a file "r2.dat", which is identical to "r1.dat" because of the
symmetry of the system (choice between the two rules).
